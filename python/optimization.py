    Calculates the optimal bid price using a Deterministic Linear Program (DLP).

    The bid price is the shadow price (dual variable) of the capacity constraint.
    This version uses the PuLP library for stability.

    Args:
        forecast: The demand forecast from the forecasting module.
        prices: The price for each fare class, e.g., {'urgent': 6000, 'leisure': 3000}
        capacity: Total number of seats.

    Returns:
        The single optimal bid price (float).
